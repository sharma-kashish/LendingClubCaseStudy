## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
    - A consumer finance company specializing in urban loans faces critical risks in its loan approval process. Approving loans for applicants likely to default leads to financial losses, while rejecting loans for creditworthy applicants results in missed business opportunities. This project aims to analyze applicant profiles to develop predictive insights that optimize loan approval decisions, balancing profitability and risk.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - The business problem is to accurately predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting, enabling the company to balance minimizing financial losses from defaults and maximizing profits by approving loans for creditworthy applicants.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - Dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.26.4
- pandas - version 2.2.2
- matplotlib - version 3.8.4
- seaborn - version 0.13.2
- plotly - version 5.22.0

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- Focus on managing DTI ratios and interest rates to reduce loan defaults.
- Monitor applicants with 10+ years of employment more closely, as they have the highest number of charged-off loans. Implement additional verification for these individuals.
- Target interventions for high-risk groups, such as renters and those with certain loan purposes.
- Monitor trends and update risk models regularly to reflect changing patterns in loan defaults.
- Pay special attention to loans for "Debt consolidation," "Credit card," and "other" purposes, which have the highest number of charged-off loans. Develop specific strategies to mitigate risks for these purposes.
- Concentrate on states like CA, NY, and FL, which have the highest number of charged-off loans. Plan risk management strategies to these regions.
- Strengthen verification processes to reduce the higher risk of charge-offs associated with unverified loans, while still closely monitoring verified loans.
